[general]

# Keep the application in sync with the monitor to prevent tearing
# It's generally recommended to keep it on, as different framerates may lead to
# unstable frametimes and a weird looking visualizer

[window]

# Keeps the window under any other
; keep_below = true

# This option aligns the window with a certain part of the screen
# Or if 'hold_size' is enabled, it also aligns the viewport using this rule
# The following positions are supported:
# top_left, top, top_right, left, center, right, bottom_left,
# bottom, bottom_right and none if you don't want manual positioning
; alignment = 'none'

# Additionally we can further adjust the position if needed (in pixels)
# It moves the window (or viewport) the opposite direction of whats in alignment
# FXP. if alignment is set to right and x_padding is 20,
# it will move the window left 20 pixels and so on for every direction

# In Layman's terms: The visualizer holds the same size as you're resizing the
# window
#
# NOTE: Works only on "supported" modes, aka non-software modes

[x11]

# Hacks and options related to X11 output modes

# Draw directly on the root window (or wallpaper) itself
# You need to stop any form of compositing for this to even work properly
; root_window = false

# Sets the override any redirection by the host WM, that is the window cannot change
# the it's order in the window stack
# This option also disables any form of interaction with the window - same as when:
#    interacable = false
; override_redirect = false

# This allows XAVA to restart when the display settings are changed
# As this can cause constant reloading (https://github.com/nikp123/xava/issues/20)
# it is left off by default (X11 only)
; reload_on_display_configure = false

# This option lets you choose a specific monitor that XAVA should occupy
# The name of the monitor is exactly the same as that of in XRandr
# Examples being: HDMI1, VGA-1
#
# If no value has been specified, XAVA treats the whole display area as a single
# monitor (if that makes sense :\)
; monitor_name = none


[wayland]

# Hacks and options related to the Wayland output mode

# Run the visualizer at "wallpaper"-level
# This makes sure that the visualizer stays behind every window.
# Enabling this automatically disables all of your inputs since
# it acts like a wallpaper, go figure. Use UNIX (kill code)
# signaling in order to reset or end XAVA.
#
# HOWEVER: This only works for compositors supporting zwlr_layer_shell
# version 1 or above. This mostly includes wlroots-based compositors.
# GNOME and KDE won't cut it here, I believe.
#
# As for when this is disabled, XAVA spawns a XDG window, but a lot of
# features are missing:
#  - keyboard and mouse input
#  - window borders (be it client-side or server-side)
#  - fullscreen mode
#  - non-transparent windows (just use background_opacity instead lol)
#  - any kind of GPU acceleration
#  - window positioning logic
#  - taskbar icon
#
# Also in XDG, XAVA may crash when resizing the window due to buffer
# related issues (If this bothers you, an issue or PR would be appreciated)
; background_layer = true

# When background_layer is enabled, this options offers you to select
# which monitor XAVA should occupy (examples: eDP-1, HDMI-A-1...)
#
# Specifying an invalid monitor would cause XAVA to fall back onto the
# last monitor available
; monitor_name = 0


[gl]

# Hacks and options related to the hardware-accelerated or "supported" modes

# XAVA's OpenGL and EGL renderers are split into two rendering pipelines:
# the "pre" and "post" rendering, that's why there are two shaders

# The following options allow for users to change their visualizer via
# different "shaderpacks" which work just the same as they do on
# Minecraft Optifine

# The pre renderer is responsible for shading the visualizer BEFORE
# the bars are drawn, this allows the shader developer to adjust the
# way that the bars are drawn on the screen
; pre_shaderpack = default

# Meanwhile the post rendering/shading is responsible for adjusting the
# look of the visualizer AFTER the bars have been drawn (fxp. adding
# shadows via depth buffer trickery)
; post_shaderpack = default

# Scale the resolution of the rendered visualizer by a floating-point factor
# Works similarly to "render resolution scalers" in modern AAA game engines
; resolution_scale = 1.0


[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are the ones listed below.
# If one doesn't work, it might not be supported by your system or it just
# wasn't compiled with it.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source' to define where it
# should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the
# monitor source of the default sink (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have
# 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
#
# For alsa, wasapi and portaudio 'source' will be the capture device.
#
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
#
# For wasapi 'source', specify 'loopback' to capture audio from the system or
# anything else to capture from an input device, such as a microphone.
#
# For pipewire, the 'source' parameter is ignored and instead the visualizer is
# supposed to be configured using an external tool, such as 'pavucontrol' (works
# on PipeWire too, trust me).
#
# You can also specify 'list' as the source to portaudio to list all available
# audio devices

[output]

# Output method. Can be any of the following (if enabled):
# Renderers are split into two categories 'supported' (aka. supports OpenGL and
# all features) and 'un-supported' (aka. custom software renderer some or many
# features)
#
# Supported renderers are: 'sdl2', 'x11', 'win', 'wayland', 'x11_egl'
# "Un-supported" renderers (*_sw denotes software rendering) are: 'sdl2_sw',
# 'wayland_sw', 'x11_sw', 'x11_sw_stars', 'ncurses'

# frequencies.

[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red,
# white, yellow. Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within '').
#
# Platform specifics:
#  - It can also be 'default' at which point under X11 it reads the color off of
#  Xrdb
#  - Under Windows 'default' uses your system accent color
#  - And on any other 'default' is just black and cyan (the default colorscheme)

# To enable gradients, just change gradient_count to the number of colors you
# have specified (0 = disabled)

# Set to 0 to disable (default).
; monstercat = 1.0

# Adjusts the FFT buffer size (calculated by 2^fft_size)
; fft_size = 14

# 'autosens' will attempt to balance the sensitivity to keep the amplitude of the bars
# within a reasonable range
; autosens = true

# 'overshoot' allows bars to overshoot (in % of display height) without initiating autosens
; overshoot = 0

# Manual sensitivity in %. Autosens must be turned off for this to take effect.
# 200.0 means double height and so on. Accepts only non-negative values.
; sensitivity = 100.0


[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# Remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
