## Configuration file for XAVA. Default values are commented out. Use either ';' or '#' for commenting.


[general]

# Accepts only non-negative values.
; framerate = 60

# Keep the application in sync with the monitor to prevent tearing
# It's generally recommended to keep it on, as different framerates may lead to unstable frametimes
# -1 = adaptive Vsync (G-Sync. FreeSync, etc.)
# 0 = off
# 1 up to refresh rate = refresh at the refresh rate of the monitor divided by the number given
; vsync = 1

# 'autosens' will attempt to balance the sensitivity to keep the amplitude of the bars 
# within a reasonable range
; autosens = true

# Manual sensitivity in %. Autosens must be turned off for this to take effect.
# 200 means double height and so on. Accepts only non-negative values.
; sensitivity = 100

# The number of bars. 0 sets it to auto (put as many as you can).
# Bars' width and space between bars in number of pixels on screen.
; bars = 0

# the bandwidth of the visualizer.
# XAVA will automatically increase the higher cutoff if a too low band is specified.
; lower_cutoff_freq = 26
; higher_cutoff_freq = 15000

# This allows XAVA to restart when the display settings are changed
# As this can cause constant reloading (https://github.com/nikp123/xava/issues/20)
# it is left off by default (X11 only)
; reload_on_display_configure = false


[window]

# Window width and height
; width = 1180
; height = 300

# Fullscreen toggle
; fullscreen = false

# Enables or disables window borders 
; border = false

# Window transparency toggle (your system must support transparent windows)
; transparency = true

# Keeps the window under any other (doesn't work in SDL)
; keep_below = true

# This option aligns the window with a certain part of the screen
# The following positions are supported:
# top_left, top, top_right, left, center, right, bottom_left,
# bottom, bottom_right and none if you don't want manual positioning
; alignment = 'none'

# Additionally we can further adjust the position if needed (in pixels)
# It moves the window the opposite direction of whats in alignment
# FXP. if alignment is set to right and x_padding is 20, 
# it will move the window left 20 pixels and so on for every direction 
; x_padding = 0
; y_padding = 0

# Enables the OpenGL renderer (not available on all output modes)
; opengl = true

# This option removes the ability to interact with the window
# NOTE: It does not work with SDL2 
; interactable = true

# Create an taskbar icon
; taskbar_icon = true

# Draw directly on the root window (or wallpaper) itself (Xorg ONLY), VERY UNPREDICTABLE
# You need to stop any form of compositing for this to even work properly
; rootwindow = false

# Sets the override any redirection by the host WM, that is the window cannot change
# the it's order in the window stack
# This option also disables any form of interaction with the window - same as when:
#    interacable = false
; override_redirect = false


[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are the ones listed below.
# If one doesn't work, it might not be supported by your system or it just wasn't compiled with it.
# 
# Defaults to the order shown below ('pulse', 'portaudio', 'alsa'...)
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source'
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
# 
# For alsa, wasapi and portaudio 'source' will be the capture device.
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
#
# In case of wasapi, specify 'loopback' to capture audio from the system or anything else 
# to capture from an input device, such as a microphone
#
# You can also specify 'list' as the source to portaudio to list all available audio devices

[output]

# Output method. Can be any of the following (if supported):
# By default it's the window that is recommended for your platform/OS.
# 'sdl' is for a graphical window using SDL2
# 'x11' is for a graphical window using X11 (usually faster, unsupported in wayland however)
# 'win' is for a win32 graphical window
; method = x11

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' averages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
; channels = mono


[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within '').
# It can also be 'default' at which point under X11 it reads the color off of Xrdb
# Under Windows it uses your system accent color
# And on SDL2 it's just black and cyan (default colorscheme)
; background = default
; foreground = default

# This adjusts the opacity of the bars (must have transparency and OpenGL in order for it to work)
; foreground_opacity = 1.0

# And this does the same but for the background (previous rule applies here as well) 
; background_opacity = 0.0

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported, background must also be defined in hex
# or remain commented out.
# To enable gradients, just change gradient_count to the number of colors you have specified
# (0 = disabled)
; gradient_count = 0
; gradient_color_1 = '#0099ff'
; gradient_color_2 = '#ff3399'



[smoothing]

# Percentage value for integral smoothing. Takes values from 0 - 100.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
; integral = 85

# Disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing" with or without "waves". Set to 0 to disable. 
; monstercat = 1.2
; waves = 0

# Set gravity percentage for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
# Accepts only non-negative values. 50 means half gravity, 200 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
; gravity = 100

# In bar height, bars that would have been lower that this (in pixels) will not be drawn.
; ignore = 0

# Adjust the logarithmic scale of the frequency band (the lower the value, 
# the less difference between bars in frequency)
; log = 1.55

# Average out the value of each odd bar (just like the monstercat visualizer)
; oddoneout = true

# Balances the eq towards higher or lower frequencies
# lower value->lower frequencies, higher value->higher frequencies
; eq_balance = 0.67

# Adjusts the input buffer size (in samples, calculated by 2^input_size)
; input_size = 12

# Adjusts the FFT buffer size (calculated by 2^fft_size)
; fft_size = 14


[shadow]

# Fake shadow effect (works with transparency only)
# To disable shadows, set size to 0
; size = 7

# Color format is #aarrggbb
; color = "#ff000000"


[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# Remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
; 1 = 1 # bass
; 2 = 1
